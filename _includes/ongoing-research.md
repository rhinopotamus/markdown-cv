## Ongoing Research Projects and Professional Work

My ongoing research and professional work is *translational*: that which focuses on or directly improves what happens in the classroom.

### JEA
[_Just Enough Algebra_](https://justenoughalgebra.org/summer-2025/just-enough-algebra) (co-author)

- Summer 2024: translated existing LaTeX files into PreTeXt, so that the book is available online as an OER
- Summer 2025 - Fall 2025: ongoing work to build activities, improve navigation, and expand coverage of topics


### PROTEUS
_PreTeXt-Runestone: Open Textbooks Engaging Undergraduates in STEM (PROTEUS)_, [NSF #2334767](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2334767&HistoricalAwards=false)

Year 1 (Fall 2024 - Summer 2025): Question development

- Invited to participate by Dr. Vilma Mesa (PI)
- Teacher participant in STAR team (Students, Teachers, Authors, Researchers)
- Regular meetings to develop and edit questions for the _Active Calculus_ textbook
- As appropriate for subject matter, employing new interactive question types available within PreTeXt books on the Runestone platform (cardsort, matching, Parsons, etc.)
- Week-long summer workshop to focus on question development and consider early data on student perceptions and responses to existing questions
- Result: several PROTEUS questions added to every section of _Active Calculus_ chapters 1-4 (corresponding to first-semester calculus courses)

Year 2 (Fall 2025 - present): Field testing and further question development

- Teaching first-semester calculus using the PROTEUS questions
- Soliciting student feedback on existing questions
- Editing existing questions in response to student feedback
- Developing questions for _Active Calculus_ chapters 5-8
