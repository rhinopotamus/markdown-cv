### Summer undergraduate research experiences

`2025` Hazel LaViolette: __Spectral graph theory.__

- A wide-ranging exploration of basic topics in spectral graph theory.
- We explored whether a similar matrix to the well-known (vertex) Laplacian of the graph, which we refer to as the _edge Laplacian_, is similarly informative about the structure of the graph.
  - We found in particular that the kernel of the edge Laplacian is related to cycles in the graph.

`2022`
Britley Ranstadler and Garrick Williams: __Donor segmentation through spectral graph theory.__

- An extension of Britley Ranstadler's term project in WCSAM 203.
- The Fiedler vector, which is the eigenvector associated with the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, is useful in clustering nodes of a graph.
- We applied this analysis to a graph of college donors to find clusters of similar donors, improving the efficacy of fundraising solicitations.
- Garrick Williams presented associated work at the April 2023 meeting of the Intermountain Section of the Mathematical Association of America.
